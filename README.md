All about cars for dummies

We created this website for car lovers or beginners looking for information about the variety of car brands and others.

We created our own individual top navigation and site pages to test each other's creativity before we decide what we wanted to show. Next, we went with Jen Fei's example chosen by a third party member from another school to give us feedback on our websites. We wanted to help users that are strangers to cars to know about the different brands and car parts. We also have a short quiz mixed with questions about the car brands, its histories, and its parts, along with an interactive 3D modelling view. 

For the mainpage, we used parallax scrolling for the background image and used horizontal scrolling for the text on top of the background image to make it slide it right. For the parralax scrolling, we used css and for horizontal scrolling of text we used javascript to make it work. For the nav bar, we used css. When the user hovers over the options, it will enlarge and change the colour of the option. For the "learn car brand" page, we made it neat by using cards to style the car logos. And the learn more button will bring the user to another HTML page and to the specific part of the page where the infomation of the specifc car brand the user selected. Next for the "Learn Car part", we used pop up windows when the user clicks on the specific car part it will bring a pop up window where it displays a 3D model of the car part the user selected and a summary of the car part. And we used java script for the close button. After that for the quizzes page, we have a short quiz of 5 questions of a total of 13 questions where the user can choose to play again after completion or go back to the mainpage. For the quiz, we used html, css and javascript. There is also a 'game' where the user can play around with 3d models of legendary cars. Lastly, we have a feedback page connected to the RestDB API for users to submit their suggestions aand critics while entering their name and email. Their feedbacks will then be displayed at the bottom of the page along with their name on the right.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users to play with 3D models of legendary cars and car parts by clicking onto it.
Feature 2 - allows users to navigate through the website from the top navigation bar
Feature 3 - Mini Quiz of 5 questions out of a total of 13 about car parts, car brands, etc.
Feature 4 - Feedback page where recent feedbacks will be displayed after user click submit

We wanted to possibly add more quizzes and videos for easier understanding for the users' experiences. Other than that, more 3d models of cars or the different type of the specific car parts could help attract more of the users attention to the website. We also wanted to make our information page more interactive or stylish instead of blocks of texts.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Some problems would be to refresh the page or go to a different page after user clicks the submit button in the feedback page. This is to ensure that the user does not think that the website is lagging and spam click the button. Spam clicking the button will result in multiple displays of the same feedback.
